Sentiment Analysis Model for Telecom Reviews

This Python-based sentiment analysis model leverages the TextBlob library to classify telecom customer reviews into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories. It achieves an accuracy of [Insert accuracy value from your output]%.

Key Features:

Simple & Effective: Utilizes TextBlob's built-in sentiment analysis capabilities for quick implementation.
Customizable: Adapts to different datasets by loading reviews from a CSV file.
Tokenization: Splits reviews into individual words for granular sentiment analysis.
Polarity Calculation: Calculates the average sentiment polarity of each word within a review to determine the overall sentiment.
Accuracy Evaluation: Compares model predictions to original labels to assess performance.
Detailed Output: Prints the number of positive, negative, and neutral reviews along with their corresponding text for further analysis.
How It Works:

Data Loading: Imports a CSV file containing telecom reviews.
Tokenization: Breaks down each review into individual words.
Sentiment Analysis: Calculates the sentiment polarity of each word using TextBlob.
Polarity Averaging: Computes the average polarity across all words in a review.
Classification: Classifies the review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the average polarity.
Accuracy Calculation: Compares the model's classifications to the original labels to determine accuracy.
Output Generation: Displays the results, including the count of each sentiment category and the full text of the reviews.
Potential Improvements:

Advanced NLP Techniques: Explore using more sophisticated natural language processing libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) for improved tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
Machine Learning: Train a machine learning model on a larger dataset to potentially achieve higher accuracy.
Contextual Understanding: Incorporate context and sentiment shifters for more nuanced sentiment analysis.
